## Running the script

It is recommended that you get RVM because several gems used by the script require Ruby 1.8 — specifically the spotlight gem’s native extensions rely upon internal structs of Ruby 1.8.

Note that if you‘ve got Readline installed earlier via MacPorts: http://beginrescueend.com/packages/readline/
